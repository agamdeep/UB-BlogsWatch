# UB-BlogsWatch
With a growing need to publish creative thoughts on a safe and an interactive source, here is a fully developed blogging website for the students of University at Buffalo, State University of New York.
University at buffalo has a total student strength of around 10000 with an additional 500 as pedagogy, yet there isin't one website where people can post blogs about technical advancements, creative story telling, personal acheivements, immigration status update.
Here we have an attempt to make sure that each student or faculty who is part of the UB family is able to write, post and publish their blogs without any impedance.

The following website is being designed and developed using PHP (code Igniter ) in the backend and Javascript, AngularJS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS in the frontend. This website would handle the following functionalities:
1) Login Page user Id, password, Forget Password Link
2) Display Articles/Blog page.
3) Add Article to the respective accunt and store it as an entry to the database
4) Edit Article of the respective accunt and store it as an entry to the database.
5) Delete Article from the database.
6) Add Pagination to the set of blogs

The following project is being developed under the esteem supervision of Dr. Bina Ramamurthy
